    Fill in variable_correlation to calculate the number of data points for which
    the directions of variable1 and variable2 relative to the mean are the
    same, and the number of data points for which they are different.
    Direction here means whether each value is above or below its mean.
    
    You can classify cases where the value is equal to the mean for one or
    both variables however you like.
    
    Each argument will be a Pandas series.
    
    For example, if the inputs were pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4]) and
    pd.Series([4, 5, 6, 7]), then the output would be (4, 0).
    This is because 1 and 4 are both below their means, 2 and 5 are both
    below, 3 and 6 are both above, and 4 and 7 are both above.
    
    On the other hand, if the inputs were pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4]) and
    pd.Series([7, 6, 5, 4]), then the output would be (0, 4).
    This is because 1 is below its mean but 7 is above its mean, and
    so on.

if num_same_direction is large then  than tells that the life expectancy and gdp are 
positively co-related. 

else it indicates a negative correlation.

if both  num_same_direction and num_different_direction are roughly equal, then 
that states there is not much of a correlation between the two variables.
